I am a theoretical quantum physicist working in the field of condensed matter physics and quantum information science. 

My research goal is to understand and uncover new aspects in quantum many-body physics through the lens of quantum information processing. 
Broadly speaking, I am interested in the following subjects:  
- quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, 
- quantum error corrections, 
- topological phases of matter and generalized global symmetries, 
- dynamics of entanglement, and
- delegated/private/distributed quantum information processing.    

A key feature that excites me about current engineered quantum devices is their mid-circuit measurement capabilities. 
My current research is focused on:
- how measurement and feedback controls can convert a quantum phase to another,  
- how a quantum many-body phase can be characterized as a resource of measurement-based quantum computation, and
- operational use of string order parameters in short-range entangled states.


I am currently a Focused Research Hub for Theoretical Physics (FRHTP) postdoctoral fellow at Quantum New Mexico Institute (QNM-i), mainly working at Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) in The University of New Mexico. 
I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Physics at the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP) at Stony Brook University in New York. I received supervision of Professor Tzu-Chieh Wei, who has offered me a variety of research opportunities. Prior to joining YITP, I was a graduate student at University of Tokyo and a part-time teacher in the Tokyo area. I worked on string field theory with Professor Yuji Okawa.
