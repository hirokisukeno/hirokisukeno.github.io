I am a theoretical quantum physicist working in the field of condensed matter physics and quantum information science. 

My research goal is to understand quantum entanglement and complexity and harness them for practical applications. These days, I am interested in relations between robust quantum information processing and stable quantum phases of matter. 
I also like to think about when and how quantum devises become useful in realistic near-term setups. Therefore, I am curious about 
- quantum simulations, 
- quantum error corrections, 
- topological phases, and 
- delegated/private/distributed quantum information processing.    

Relatedly, another aspect that excites me about current engineered quantum devices is their mid-circuit measurement capacities. 
In this regard, I am interested in:
- how measurement can convert a quantum phase of matter to another, and 
- how quantum many-body phases can be characterized as resources of measurement-based quantum computation.


I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP) at Stony Brook University in New York. I'm receiving supervision of Professor Tzu-Chieh Wei. Prior to joining YITP, I was a graduate student at University of Tokyo and a part-time teacher in the Tokyo area. I worked on string field theory with Professor Yuji Okawa.
